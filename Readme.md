How many times did you tranlsated a foreign word just to completely forget it some time after?

You can review or even study saved vocabulary, manage it and even read contextual material like A.I. generated stories and more... on the way ;)

The inserted text on the 'source field' is automaticly tokenized and tagged, useful for reviewing the syntax of the language.
